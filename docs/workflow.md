# Workflow

## Summary

- Create new branch (not fork)
- Add commits to your branch
- Open a Pull Request
- Someone else reviews the changes and merges them to the master branch

Remember: Everything in the <code>master</code> branch is always deployable!

## Creating a new branch

Changes you make on a branch don't affect the <code>master</code> branch, so you're free to experiment.

To create a new branch:

	git checkout -b branch-name

Commit your changes and push them to the branch:

	git push origin branch-name

Use descriptive names for the branches, lowercase letters and hyphens.
